# Space Ops Australia Cubesat Educational Program
What is a cubesat? How is a cubesat? Why is a cubesat? 

You may have these questions from time to time. At Space Ops, we did and went through the process to learn. Along that process of learning, we knew that others would also like to know the answers to some of these questions, so we have endevoured to provide some simple resources to help others become educated.

This educational program relies on Arduino and some physical hardware to develop a functional but low cost satellite analog that can demonstrate the principles of satellite design and operation.

Our cubesat kit is based upon our laser cut wooden cubesat frame which can be found here. https://spaceops.com.au/products/cubesat-wooden-test-frame . We built these frames to make our lives easier when we needed a cubesat stand in when developing payload bays and estimating dimensions.

This code repository will house most of the code and resources to allow readily available Arduino sensors to be connected together under the Seeeduino Platform. To read more about Seeeduino, check out their website. https://www.seeedstudio.com/

This is our first run of the program and always appreciate feedback. This first version is a beginners program with newcomers experiencing Arduino or the Seeeduino platform for the first time. In the near future, we aim to release a more advanced satellite program with better sensors but soldering will be required!

# The program
# About the lessons
This code repository is split into code for each individual sensor and also a variety of differing combinations of these sensors to develop sense and response displays. We've gone to the effort to compile the required code to run these sensors and provide suitable output.

The key principle of this program is to appreciate that a satellite requires many systems to function but must also achieve a purpose. So we have sensors which will tell us about the environment but have electronics which can provide us with feedback of the state of the system.

# Board
Seeeduino Lotus v1.1 or greater - This is a great platform to reduce the amount of soldering required. Perfect for someone looking to build quickly. But the option to use the headers are still available and do other things on top.

# Sensors
Temperature & Humidity Sensor - Measure the temperature and moisture levels in the environment.

Air Quality Sensor - Measure the CO2 in an environment.

6-Axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope - Measure the state of the satellite 

3-Axis Digital Compass - Measure orientation

Loudness Sensor - Detection of audio

Sunlight Sensor - Direction of the sun or strength of the UV light

Speaker - Outputs audio

Buzzer - Outputs a buzzing sound

RGB LED Stick - Outputs a rainbow of colours with 10 RGB SMD lights.

# Accessories
10 x 5cm jumper cables - Help connect the sensors

1 x Micro-USB cable - Connects the Arduino to your computer.
